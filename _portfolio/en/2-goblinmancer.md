#### The goblin brethren are not too fond of your antics. A shame their corpses will be the bricks of your undead empire.
<br>
GoblinMancer is a tower-defence game where you build your citadel and struggle to survive day after day defending against hordes of goblins who want you dead... no, that ain't the word. Let's say destroyed.

Use the flesh and bones of the fallen to construct an army, towers, crypts and laboratories; burn their blood in sacrilegious ritual to smite them with spells of fire and thunder.

Look at them, their funny ears, confident demeanour, their festivities echoing through to your cursed able hearing. They all hate you, and have no place for you in their world. Let it be so, their world torn asunder. You won't go down without a fight, will you?

###### This  game is still in early stages of development, and will in time get a demo release faithful to its direction after its experimental version found success.

You can find the prototype, made for a game jam, on [itch.io](https://kiskidiego.itch.io/goblinmancer).
