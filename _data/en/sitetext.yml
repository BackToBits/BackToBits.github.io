    title: Who We Are
    body: "We are a team of young developers that met during university and joined forces to make video games. We have tried and failed at tackling a massive project, worked together on many Game Jams and are now developing commercial releases of our most acclaimed and inspired games after four years working together.\n\n
Our team members have diversified skill sets involving all steps of video game development while being specialized in their most passionate fields, we have dedicated tool developers and contributors to academia alike, building our DNA on the basis of a comprehensive view of interactive software design and development. As an indie team being diverse, lean and capable of shifting our style is a large part of our drive to create.\n\n
We are highly passionate, and video game development to us is a deep, grateful expression of ourselves and our love for what this medium has to offer."
