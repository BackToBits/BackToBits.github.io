The nearby goblin kingdom has grown uneasy with your presence and they've sent troops to your evil tower. You must destroy the attacking forces and reanimate their bodies to strengthen your dark army.

Every enemy you defeat becomes a zombie that will fight for you! sacrifice their flesh and blood to build towers and strengthen your evil dwelling, unlock and cast spells with a variety of effects and summon even greater subjects.
