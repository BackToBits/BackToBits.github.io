#### A power too sweet to give up, flesh stolen from your sibling soul.

In your hands lay a codex of malformed skin, its voice loving and caring. It speaks of unending life, sorrow and hope.

Time for thought is over, for now, as something stirs in the wilderness. Your crimes haven't gone unnoticed, and goblinkind do not appreciate their dead being messed with. Maybe, some day in the past or future, you might have called them friends and fellows; maybe, some day in the past or future, your sibling soul might have had something to say. It lays quiet, however.

Fight for your survival, for your victory over the living, for a chance to learn more about what you have done, in coming here...

Or fight for fun!
